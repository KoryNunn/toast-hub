# toast-hub

Desktop notifications for github

## Usage

Probably don't

But if you don't mind a really shitty extension floating around in your chrome:

1. Clone the repo somewhere
- In chrome, go to tools, extensions
- Make sure you are a developer (checkbox at the top)
- Click "Load unpacked extension..."
- Find the folder you cloned, and load it
- Done

## But I have firefox!

Pull requests welcome.

## Warning

This is probably some of the worst code I've ever written. This extension WILL break.

## Future

I plan to make this not a total pile of excrement.
